**Taotao Picking Apple**

**Problem description**

There is an apple tree in Taotao's yard. Every autumn, the tree bear 10 apples. When the apples are ripe, Taotao would run to pick them. Taotao has a 30cm high bench. When she can't pick apples directly by raising hands, she steps on the bench and tries again.

Now that we know the height of 10 apples to the ground and the maximum height Taotao can reach with her hands raised straight, please help Taotao calculate the number of apples she can pick. Assume that the apple will fall when she touches the apple.

**Input**

The input file contains two lines of data. The first line contains 10 integers (in centimeters) between 100 and 200 (including 100 and 200), representing the height of 10 apples to the ground, separated by a space between every two adjacent integers. The second line contains only an integer (in centimeters) between 100 and 120 (including 100 and 120), indicating the maximum height Taotao can reach with her hands raised straight.

**Output**

The output file contains a single line that contains only one integer, representing the number of apples that Taotao can pick.
