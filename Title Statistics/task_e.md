**\[Explanation for Sample 1\]**

The title has three characters, all of which are numeric.

**\[Explanation for Sample 2\]**

The title contains 5 characters, including 1 uppercase English letter, 1 lowercase English letter, 2 numeric characters, and 1 space. Since spaces are not counted in the result, the valid number of characters for the title is 4.

**\[Data Size and Constraints\]**

∣s∣ represents the length of the string s (the number of characters and spaces in the string).

For 40% of the data, 1≤∣s∣≤5, it is ensured that the inputs are numeric characters and newline characters at the end of lines.

For 80% of the data, 1≤∣s∣≤5, the input can only contain upper and lower case English letters, numeric characters, and newline characters.

For 100% of the data, 1≤∣s∣≤5, the input may contain upper and lower case English letters, numeric characters, spaces, and newline characters at the end of lines.
