**Abacus Mental Arithmetic Test**

**Problem Description**

Abacus Mental Arithmetic is a technique of making fast calculations by simulating the changes of an abacus in one's mind. Abacus Mental Arithmetic training, not only can develop intelligence, but also can bring a lot of convenience to daily life, so it is popular in many schools.

The Abacus Mental Arithmetic teacher at a school used a quick test to see students' ability of doing addition problems using Abacus Mental Arithmetic. He randomly generated a set of positive integers with no duplicates, and asked the students to answer: How many of these numbers are exactly equal to the sum of the other two (different) numbers in the set?

Recently the teacher gave some test questions, please help to find the answers.

**Input**

There are two lines. The first line is an integer n, representing the number of positive integers given in the test.

The second line contains n positive integers, separated by spaces, representing the positive integers given in the test.

For 100% of the data, 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, the positive integers given by the quiz do not exceed 10,000.

**Output**

There is one line that contains an integer, representing the answer of the test.

**Sample Input**

4

1 2 3 4

**Sample Output**

2

**Hint**

1+2=3, 1+3=4, so the answer that satisfies the test requirement is 2. Note that the two addends must be two different numbers in the set.
