**Statistics**

**Problem Description**

Count the number of occurrences of digit 2 among all integers in a given range \[L, R\].

For example, given the range \[2, 22\], the digit 2 appears once in the number 2, once in the number 12, once in the number 20, once in the number 21, and twice in the number 22, so the digit 2 appears six times in the given range.

**\[Constraints\]**

1 ≤ L ≤ R≤ 10000.

**Input**

The input consists of one line of two positive integers L and R, separated by a space.

**Output**

The output consists of one line, representing the number of occurrences of the digit 2.

**Sample Input**

2 22

**Sample Output**

6
