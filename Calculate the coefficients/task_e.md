**Calculate the coefficients**

**Problem Description**

Given a polynomial (by+ax)^k^, please calculate the coefficients of the x^n^× y^m^ term when the polynomial is expanded.

**Input**

The input is only one line and contains 5 integers called a,b,k,n,m, separated by spaces.

**Output**

The output is only one line and contains an integer representing the desired coefficient.

This coefficient can be very large, so output the result modulo 10007.

**Sample Input**

1 1 3 1 2

**Sample Output**

3

**Hint**

**\[Data Range\]**

For 30% of the data, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10.

For 50% of the data, a=1, b=1.

For 100% of the data, 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ n, m ≤ k, n+m=k, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6^.
