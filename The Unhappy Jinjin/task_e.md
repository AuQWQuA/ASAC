**The Unhappy Jinjin**

**Problem Description**

Jinjin is now in junior high school. Her mother thinks that Jinjin should study harder, so in addition to going to school, Jinjin has to attend the review classes her mother signed her up for. Moreover, her mother sends her to learn recitation, dance and piano every week. But Jinjin will be unhappy if she goes to class for more than eight hours a day, and the longer she goes, the unhappier she will become. Assuming Jinjin doesn't get upset about anything else, and that her unhappiness won't last to the next day. Please help to check Jinjin's schedule for next week and see if she will be unhappy next week. If so, which day will be the unhappiest day.

**Input**

The input contains seven lines of data representing the schedule from Monday to Sunday. Each line contains two non-negative integers less than 10, separated by a space, indicating the time Jinjin attends school and the time of her classes which her mother scheduled.

**Output**

The output includes a line that contains only one number. If Jinjin will not be unhappy, it prints 0. If she will, it prints the unhappiest day of the week (Numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, indicating Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, respectively). If there are two or more days of equal levels of unhappiness, output the first one.
