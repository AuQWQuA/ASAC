**Gathering herbs**

**Problem description**

Chenchen is a gifted child; his dream is to become the greatest physician in the world. Therefore, he wanted to be taught by the most respected physician in the neighborhood. The physician set a difficult problem for him in order to judge his qualifications. The physician took him to a cave full of herbs and said to him: "My son, there are several different herbs in this cave. It takes some time to gather each plant, and each plant has its own value. I will give you a period of time during which you can gather some herbs. If you are a clever child, you should be able to maximize the total value of the herbs you gather."

If you were Chenchen, could you finish the task?

**Input**

The first line of the input file has two integers, T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100), separated by a space. T represents the total amount of time available for picking herbs, and M represents the number of herbs in the cave.

The next M lines each contain two integers between 1 and 100 (including 1 and 100), representing the time it takes to pick a herb and the value of that herb.

**Output**

Output the maximum total value of herbs that can be collected in the given time.
