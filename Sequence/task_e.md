**Sequence**

**Problem description**

Given a positive integer k (3 ≤ k ≤ 15), form an increasing sequence of all powers of k and the sum of all finite powers of k that are not equal to each other. For example, when k = 3, the sequence is:

1,3,4,9,10,12,13\...

(the sequence is actually: 3^0^, 3^1^, 3^0^ +3^1^, 3^2^, 3^0^+3^2^, 3^1^+3^2^, 3^0^+3^1^+3^2^, \...)

Please find the value of the N^th^ term in this sequence (expressed in decimal numbers).

For example, for k = 3 and N = 100, the correct answer would be 981.

**Input**

The input file contains two positive integers, separated by a space:

k N (the meanings of k and N are the same as the above problem description, and 3 ≤ k ≤ 15,10 ≤ N ≤ 1000).

**Output**

The output file is a positive integer (No spaces or other symbols before integers).

**Sample Input**

3 100

**Sample Output**

981
